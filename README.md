## About this clicky game

This clicky game was created early July of 2018. It is my first project using React on the front end. I bootstrapped this using Yarn and create-react-app. I will deploy through Heroku. 

## How to play
12 images are rendered to the page. The user starts by clicking the pictures. Clicking on a picture once adds to the current score whereas clicking the same picture a second time will end the game and reset the score. The highscore will also be listed on the page. 

## Future

I'd like to add some features and versions, such as:

### `style`

I would like to experiment with styling the app<br>
Experiment with colors. Perhaps a version using Bootstrap. 

### `version`

Repackaging this under different themes could also be fun.<br>
Adding music and doing a band theme.<br>
Foods - scratch and sniff.
